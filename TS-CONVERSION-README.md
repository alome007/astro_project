# TypeScript Conversion Completed

Your backend-node project has been converted to TypeScript. Here's what was done:

1. **Added TypeScript dependencies** to package.json:
   - TypeScript compiler
   - Type definitions for libraries (Express, Node.js, etc.)
   - ESLint plugins for TypeScript

2. **Created a tsconfig.json** file for TypeScript configuration.

3. **Converted JavaScript files to TypeScript**:
   - Changed file extensions from `.js` to `.ts`
   - Added type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return values
   - Converted require() statements to import statements
   - Added interfaces for complex data structures

4. **Updated scripts in package.json**:
   - Added build script to compile TypeScript
   - Updated start and dev scripts

## Next Steps

To complete the conversion, please run:

```bash
# Make the conversion script executable
chmod +x ts-conversion.sh

# Run the conversion script
./ts-conversion.sh
```

This script will:
1. Install the required dependencies
2. Remove the old JavaScript files (optional)
3. Build the TypeScript files

## Running the Application

After running the conversion script, you can:

```bash
# Run in development mode with automatic reloading
npm run dev

# Build the TypeScript files
npm run build

# Run in production mode
npm start
```
